It works to build evidence, narratives, networks, and action for pro-people, pro-humanity and pro-ecology changes in society, with a focus on the gender-sexuality minority communities from East and North East India, and the backdrop of the equal rights movement in the larger Bay of Bengal Region. It started its journey in late 2020 with a dual focus on ground-level climate issues and gender-sexuality rights and later consolidated its objectives to focus its work primarily on enabling equal rights and access for gender-sexuality minorities.',

Working at the crossroads of mental health, social justice, and community care, MHI supports grassroots and community-led initiatives that center lived experiences, challenge systemic barriers, and prioritize care for marginalized populationsâ€”including gender and sexual minorities, Dalit and Adivasi communities, persons with disabilities, and others historically excluded from mainstream mental health narratives. Since its inception in 2014, MHI has aimed to democratize mental health by amplifying alternative voices, supporting psychosocial well-being, and building sustainable, community-rooted ecosystems of care across India.',
